### Design summary
- The left 70%-ish of the window should include the embedded ChatGPT webview 
- The right 30%-ish of the window should include a toggle
- The toggle should include a list of meta prompts
- Double click to add or edit meta prompts
- Single click to add meta prompt to the text box

### Nice to haves

- Fast and minimal UI
- Handling if user isn't logged in



### Testing
